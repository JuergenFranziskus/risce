# Low and High
Since a 32 bit immediate does not fit into a single instruction,
it has to be generated by two.  
To aid a human (me) writer with this, the low and high functions
can be used to automatically extract the relevant bits from a large constant.  
The low function produces a value that fits into 12 bits.  
Their values are defined by the following identity:  
(low X) + ((high X) << 12) = X  


# Rel
The rel function can be used to construct pc-relative constant values.  
It takes either one or two parameters.  
The first parameter is the value to make relative.  
The second parameter is the absolute address that the first should be made relative to.  
If the second parameter is not present, it is assumed to be the current line's address.

# Prep
Prep is a function that combines the high and rel functions for convenience.  
It has two forms:
- prep x y = high (rel x y)
- prep x = high (rel x)

# Fin
Fin is the same as prep, except with low instead of high:
- fin x y = low (rel x y)
- fin x = low (rel x)
